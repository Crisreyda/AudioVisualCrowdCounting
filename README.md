# AudioVisualCrowdCounting
This is the code for AudioVisual crowd counting. To use the code you need to install PyTorch-1.0 and Python 3.7.

## Dataset
We propose a new dataset for crowd counting, which is composed of around 2000 annotaed images token in different locations in China and each image corresponds to a 1 second audio clip and a density map. The images are in different illuminations. More details can be found in our paper [Ambient Sound Helps: Audiovisual Crowd Counting in Extreme Conditions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.07097) and you can download the dataset [here](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3828467).

## Train
1. Download the dataset including [images](https://zenodo.org/record/3828468/files/images.zip?download=1), [audios](https://zenodo.org/record/3828468/files/audio.zip?download=1) and [density maps](https://zenodo.org/record/3828468/files/density_maps.zip?download=1).
