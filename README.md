# AudioVisualCrowdCounting
This is the code for AudioVisual crowd counting. To use the code you need to install PyTorch-1.0 and Python 3.7.

## Dataset
We propose a new dataset for crowd counting, which is composed of around 2000 annotaed images token in different locations in China and each image corresponds to a 1 second audio clip and a density map. The images are in different illuminations. More details can be found in our paper [Ambient Sound Helps: Audiovisual Crowd Counting in Extreme Conditions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.07097) and you can download the dataset [here](10.5281/zenodo.3828467).
